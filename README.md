# Student Grade Tracker - Java Project

Hi,  
This is my first project as part of the Java Internship at CodeAlpha. I built a simple console-based Student Grade Tracker in Java to help manage and analyze student grades.

## About the Project

The Student Grade Tracker is a Java program that:
- Takes input for student names and their grades
- Calculates the average, highest, and lowest scores
- Displays a summary report of all students
- Is built using ArrayLists, loops, and basic OOP concepts

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koradee/CodeAlpha_StudentGradeTracker.git
2.Open the project in any Java IDE
3.Compile and run StudentGradeTracker.java


========================================

Sample Output==
Enter number of students: 3
Enter name: SK
Enter grade: 90
Enter name: PK
Enter grade: 85
Enter name: JK
Enter grade: 76

--- Summary ---
SK: 90
PK: 85
JK: 76
Average: 83.67
Highest: 90
Lowest: 76
